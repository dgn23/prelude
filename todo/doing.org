** So I think org-doing is just a wrapper over some basic org-mode functionality
I've set it up so that the org-doing (for now, or for this very doc at least) goes into my todo file in my .emacs.
*** I might want to move this into ~/org/ though...
** Check out [[file:~/.emacs.d/el-get/org-doing/README.md][Org-doing Readme.org]]
